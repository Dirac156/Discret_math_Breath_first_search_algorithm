# Breath First Search Algorithm

## Description

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm used for traversing graph data structures. In other words,  BFS implements a specific strategy for visiting all the nodes (vertices) of a graph – more on graphs in a while. What is this exploration strategy? It’s very simple and effective. BFS starts with a node, then it checks the neighbours of the initial node, then the neighbours of the neighbours, and so on. In case you didn’t recall it, two vertices are ‘neighbours’ if they are connected with an edge.

## Implementation

### Vertices

Use a normal data type (string or integer).

### Edges

Edges are related by order of index in the visited list.

### Up level

Dictionaries are used to store levels that contains other level inside  

### Up level with one level inside

A list is used to store a up level inside
